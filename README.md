A Floating Action Button (FAB) is a round button that floats near the bottom right of a content area. This button represents the primary action for the corresponding content, but sometimes, there is no primary action. Instead, there are a few critical actions that the user might take. In this case, you could create an expandable FAB like the one shown in the following figure. When pressed, this expandable FAB spawns multiple, other action buttons. Each button corresponds to one of those critical actions.
